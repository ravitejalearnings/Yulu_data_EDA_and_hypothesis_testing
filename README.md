The focus was on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applying hypothesis testing to validate business assumptions.

# Objectives
Explore data distributions, correlations, and outliers in rental data.
Identify key features influencing bike rental demand (e.g., weather, temperature, humidity, windspeed, seasonality).
Apply hypothesis testing to validate business questions.

# Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels)
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
